#  amrlib

**A python library that makes AMR parsing, generation and visualization simple.**


## About
amrlib is a python module designed to make processing for [Abstract Meaning Representation](https://amr.isi.edu/)
 (AMR) simple by providing the following functions
* Sentence to Graph (StoG) parsing to create AMR graphs from English sentences.
* Graph to Sentence (GtoS) generation for turning AMR graphs into English sentences.
* A QT based GUI to facilitate conversion of sentences to graphs and back to sentences
* Methods to plot AMR graphs in both the GUI and as library functions
* Training and test code for both the StoG and GtoS models.
* A [SpaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) extension that allows direct conversion of
SpaCy `Docs` and `Spans` to AMR graphs.


## AMR Models
The system uses two different Neural Network models for parsing and generation.

The parsing (StoG) model comes from [AMR-gs](https://github.com/jcyk/AMR-gs), the details of which
can be found in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05572).  The version of the model used here eliminates
much of the data abstraction (aka anonymization) used in the original code.  During testing, this model
achieves a 77 SMATCH score with LDC2020T02.

The generation (GtoS) model takes advantage of the pretrained [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
T5 transformer.  The model is fine-tuned to translate AMR graphs to English sentences.  The retrained model
achieves a BLEU score of 43 with LDC2020T02.

## AMR View
The GUI allows for simple viewing, conversion and plotting of AMR Graphs.

## Requirements and Installation
The project was built and tested under Python 3 and Ubuntu but should run on any Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.. system.

See [Installation Instructions](docs/install.md) for details on setup.

## Library Usage
To convert sentences to grahs
```
import amrlib
stog = amrlib.load_stog_model()
graphs = stog.parse_sents(['This is a test of the system.', 'This is a second sentence.'])
for graph in graphs:
    print(graph)
```
To convert graphs to sentences
```
import amrlib
gtos = amrlib.load_gtos_model()
sents, _ = gtos.generate(graphs, disable_progress=True)
for sent in sents:
    print(sent)
```
For a detailed description see the [Model API](https://amrlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_model/).


## Usage as a Spacy Extension
To use as an extension, you need spaCy version 2.0 or later.  To setup the extension and use it do the following
```
import amrlib
import spacy
amrlib.setup_spacy_extension()
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc = nlp('This is a test of the SpaCy extension. The test has multiple sentences.')
graphs = doc._.to_amr()
for graph in graphs:
    print(graph)
```
For a detailed description see the [Spacy API](https://amrlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_spacy/).

## Issues
If you find a bug, please report it on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/bjascob/amrlib/issues).
Additionally, if you have feature requests or questions, feel free to post there as well.  I'm happy to
consider suggestions and Pull Requests to enhance the functionality and usability of the module.
