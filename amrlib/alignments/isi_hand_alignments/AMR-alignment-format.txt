This is the "isi" alignment format which is not the same as the JAMR alignment format.

Example:

# ::id nw.wsj_0003.5 ::amr-annotator ISI-AMR-01 ::preferred
# ::tok A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
# ::alignments 1-1.1.1.1.2.1 2-1.1.1.2 3-1 6-1.2.1 7-1.2.1.r 9-1.2.2 10-1.2
(s / say-01~e.3
  :ARG0 (p / person
          :ARG0-of (h / have-org-role-91
                     :ARG1 (c / company :wiki "Lorillard_Tobacco_Company"
                             :name (l / name :op1 "Lorillard"~e.1))
                     :ARG2 (s2 / spokeswoman~e.2)))
  :ARG1 (s3 / story~e.10
           :domain~e.7 (t / this~e.6)
           :mod (o2 / old~e.9)))

Explanation:

The alignment files show alignment in two (redundant) formats.
(1) Alignment suffixes "~e.n" attached to concepts, strings, roles, or 
    (reentrant) variables, where "n" is the nth token of the sentences 
    (starting at 0).
    Example: say-01~e.3 means that the concept say-01 aligns to token 3 ("said").
(2) The line starting with "# ::alignments" is a list of alignments of
    form n-1.x.y.z[.r] where "n" is the nth token of the sentences (starting at 0)
    and where "1" designates the root node of the amr (say-01), "1.x" is
    the x-th sub-amr of that root node (starting at 1), "1.x.y" is the y-th 
    sub-amr of "1.x" etc.
    The suffix ".r" designates the role of a sub-amr.
    Example: 10-1.2 means that there is an alignment between token 10 ("story")
	     and the second sub-tree of the amr root ("(s3 / story)").
	     7-1.2.1.r means that there is an alignment between token 7 ("is")
	     and the role of the first sub-tree of the second sub-tree of the
	     root amr (":domain").
	    
Notes regarding XML tags in tokenized text
(1) xml tags count as a single token, even if they contain spaces.
    Example:
       # ::tok A <a href="http://www.cnn.com"> CNN </a> report.
       Token 0: A
       Token 1: <a href="http://www.cnn.com">
       Token 2: CNN
       Token 3: </a>
       Token 4: report
(2) If the sentence starts with an xml tag, it does not count as a token.
    This is admittedly somewhat odd. We plan to fix this in future releases.
    Example:
       # ::tok <a href="http://www.cnn.com"> CNN </a> report
       Token 0: CNN
       Token 1: </a>
       Token 2: report
